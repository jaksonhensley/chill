# chill
Chill is a POS system written in Swift and Python. The goal is to create a workable (and hopefully better) replacement for Focus.


# Goals
My goals for chill are to be easy to use while being powerful enough to not need to rely on anything else. (This sounds stupid, finish later)

# Phase 1
In Phase 1 I would like to draft out the basic concepts in Java since I have the best understanding of working in that language.
